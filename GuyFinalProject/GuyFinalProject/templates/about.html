This project was done on my Data-Science course in my school, Tichonet in Tel-Aviv. This project is one part of the 
Final-Project by the end of the semester. In this project I used flask bootstrap and flask wtf, In addition,
I used html language and python language. I have done all of this Project on Visual-Studio. By the start of the 
year We are instructed to take 6-10 photos and do Gallery. Also, I chose 2 datasets in this project To find the 
connection between them. The 2 datasets I chose Was on Seattle Car Accidents and Seattle Weather. On my DateQuery page you can put
start date and end date and you will see the graph with the connection between the weather and the number of car accidents on that date.
